## Summary of Learning
(FROM ODIN 4
* was able to build DOM pieces using Javascript.  and style them.
* practiced for loops. 
* knobs were interesting to get to work.  Figured out x/y position of mouse within a div.  translate to rotation degrees.
* practiced setting the size of the app.   Window size changes don't affect it.  This made the dials work better.
* the Sketch an Etch logo was interesting to get working.   Color gradients + text.
* tried getting white workspace size to adjust to red outline.   Messed up pixel sizes...
* More practice with event listeners.  
* Originally used buttons before dials.  Practiced setting them up.
* Realized I can't draw well with this sort of thing.
